# single_cycle_cpu
the instruction we use: RISCV edition<br>           
I have done: <br>
>R type<br>I type //load, jalr,addi,ori and so on<br>
S type //store<br>
J type //jal<br>
4 kinds of instructions<br>


## Update changing single cycle cpu to pipeline
Have done forward uniting but `Hazard unit` and `branch prediction` aren't implement<br>
